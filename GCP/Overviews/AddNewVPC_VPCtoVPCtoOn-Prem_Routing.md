Red: steps and required communication

**Scenario:**

  - How to configure a new VPC to communicate with an existing VPC and use the existing HA-VPN tunnel?
  - Internet-bound traffic from on-premises should not pass through the cloud, thats why configure default gateway on-prem to not VPN next hop.
  - Since the HA-VPN tunnel is already configured in the existing VPC, the new VPC must establish connectivity with the existing one.

**Technical assumptions:**

2 VPCs, no overlaping addresses.
One VPC connected to on-prem trough HA-VPN.

**Steps/Solution:**

1. Peer both VPCs
    - Configure VPC Network Peering to export custom routes from VPC-1.
    - Configure VPC Network Peering to import custom routes into New-VPC
2. Advertise IP ranges to the on-prem in existing VPC
    - Use Cloud Routerâ€™s custom route advertisements to announce the peered VPC network ranges to the on-premises locations.
3. Create a Custom Route in the New VPC
    - Set up a custom next-hop route so that all on-prem-bound traffic in the new VPC is forwarded via the existing VPC.
4. VPC firewall rules must allow traffic between the new VPC, the existing VPC, and on-prem.
    - Add firewall rules to allow traffic for subnets used in both VPCs.

**Additional Description:**

**Final Result:**
- The new VPC is connected to the existing VPC via VPC Peering.
- Traffic from the new VPC can reach on-prem via the existing HA-VPN tunnel.
- On-prem can recognize and return traffic to the new VPC, thanks to Cloud Router advertisements.
- Firewall rules allow smooth communication across all networks.

Alternative Approach: Using VPC Network Connectivity Center. See other Overview in this folder
- If VPC Peering is not preferred, you can use VPC Network Connectivity Center to establish a hub-and-spoke model.
- This allows multiple VPCs to connect via a central hub without requiring full VPC Peering.

**Commands:**

Step1

      gcloud compute networks peerings create new-vpc-to-existing-vpc \
      --network=new-vpc \
      --peer-network=existing-vpc \
      --export-custom-routes \
      --import-custom-routes
      gcloud compute networks peerings create existing-vpc-to-new-vpc \
      --network=existing-vpc \
      --peer-network=new-vpc \
      --export-custom-routes \
      --import-custom-routes

Step 2

      gcloud compute routers update existing-vpc-router \
      --advertisement-mode=CUSTOM \
      --set-advertisement-ranges=10.20.0.0/16

      gcloud compute routes create new-vpc-to-onprem \
      --network=new-vpc \
      --destination-range=10.0.0.0/8 \
      --next-hop-vpn-tunnel=existing-vpc-ha-vpn \
      --priority=1000

Step 3

      gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-new-vpc-traffic \
      --network=new-vpc \
      --allow tcp,udp,icmp \
      --source-ranges=10.0.0.0/8

      gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-existing-vpc-traffic \
      --network=existing-vpc \
      --allow tcp,udp,icmp \
      --source-ranges=10.20.0.0/16
